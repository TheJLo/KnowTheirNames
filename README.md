# KnowTheirNames
List of, and stickers for, all of those killed within the Hamas-Zionist Conflict after the Oct. 7th, 2023 Hamas Attack on Israel. Includes the names of those killed in Gaza due to bombardment from Netanyahu's Government as well as (WIP) the names of Israelis killed or kidnapped by Hamas.

The stickers are generated using Inkscape and NextGenerator. Look up NextGenerator and its tutorials for usage of the extension. All stickers and data are released under GNU General Public License v3.0. Please treat this data and these stickers with respect. These are the names of the thousands of those killed within Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, etc. These are the names of people with families and friends, lives and dreams, histories both personal and communal; that were cut short due to xenophobia, neo-colonialism and the petty pursuits of politicians and warhawks.

The raw data for Gazan Causalties was provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza and uploaded and reported on by Mondoweiss here: https://mondoweiss.net/2023/10/this-is-a-list-of-the-names-of-more-than-6000-palestinians-that-israel-has-killed-in-gaza/

Haaretz has reported on the names of those killed and kidnapped in Israel and will be the primary source for the list of names of Isaelis. 

Al-Jazeera has also released a list of names of those killed in Gaza, however they never sent me a computer accessible version (such as a csv or pdf) of those names (I asked to no reply).  

Data was input and parsed by a single person. There may be mistakes and/or missing people. If a mistake is found, or you know of someone who should be added to this list, please notify me or make the corrections yourself and upload them to github. I will do my best to verify the corrections and add them to this repository.
